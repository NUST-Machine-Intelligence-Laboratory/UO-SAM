## abstract

Unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) aims to achieve high-quality segmentation without manual pixel-level annotations. Existing USS models provide coarse category classification for regions, but the results often have blurry and imprecise edges. Recently, a robust framework called the segment anything model (SAM) has been proven to deliver precise boundary object masks. Therefore, this paper proposes a universal organizer based on SAM, termed as UOSAM, to enhance the mask quality of USS models. Specifically, using only the original image and the masks generated by the USS model, we extract visual features to obtain positional prompts for target objects. Then, we activate a lolal region optimizer that performs segmentation using SAM on a per-object basis. Finally, we employ a global region optimizer to incorporate global image information and refine the masks to obtain the final fine-grained masks. Compared to existing methods, our UO-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.
